      <overview>Dialogic (formerly Eicon Networks) are a global manufacturer of ISDN and DSL
hardware. After doing my work experience there as part of the BSc in
Software Development and Computer Networks, I was hired as a software engineer
for the embedded team.  There I worked primarily on protocol stacks for the
various firmwares (always in C). After some time, I moved onto developing
Windows drivers in C++. I discovered first Python and then Ruby whilst looking
for a solution to improve the build system for a newly acquired line of ISDN
modems and their driver packages. I later had the opportunity to write an early
Rails application which generates certificates for enabling driver features in
Eicon's entire telephony range. Thus encouraged, I decided to work on Rails
full-time.

      <company>Travel IQ</company>
      <overview>Travel IQ was my first experience with a start-up, and it brought me to
Berlin. In 2006, after a telephone interview with the CTO, I was asked to come
to Berlin to meet the team of the fledgeling startup. I moved to Friedrichshain
in February 2007, and worked with Mathias and 4 part-time students to get the
app online for August 1st. After the launch, as senior developer/architect in an
expanding team, we set about re-writing the platform for Rails 2. In October
2008, version 2 was live, and in 2009, the company was aquired by Check24.
Mission accomplished, I left to travel.

      <company>eBay</company>
      <overview>In between travels, I've done some project work for eBay GmbH in Dreilinden.
I've whipped together a gem for using the eBay Trading API, and have built a
couple of Rails apps (one in Rails 2.3, and a more recent one Rails 3.2) which
are used for ranking signed-up users by their eBay trading data. The apps are
used internally by eBay to encourage customer engagement, and to push particular
verticals as needed. Other work includes a HTML5 photo-gallery (my first
introduction to CarrierWave), and a mobile front-end to the eBay Open
Global Competition app. As this is likely to continue, I spend some spare time
improving the eBay Open JSON API, and the open-source eBayR gem.

      <company>TrainMySelf</company>
      <overview>TrainMySelf GmbH is a company founded in 2011 by three guys from South Tyrol
and me (as CTO and lead - sometimes only - developer). The idea was to
produce an iPhone and Android app that delivers customized training plans to
marathon runners. Over the last year, we've hired a couple of additional
developers part-time and graphic designers, and it's grown to more of an
app-platform - with an administration interface to allow customization of
the mobile apps, and a delivery system for PhoneGap applications, all
powered by a JSON API which generates the training plans (in three
languages). TrainMySelf is due to be in beta in early June, at which point I
will be ready to devote the bulk of my energy to another exciting project.
