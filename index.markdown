=========

Here you may find some random musings about [open source][oss] [projects][gh]
which I may or may not be working on (and which are hosted on
[GitHub][github]).

I'm a software developer with a background in C on embedded devices, who has
moved towards [Ruby][ruby] and (more recently) [JavaScript][js]. Working as
a [freelancer][bjjbuckley], a CTO, opportunities arise from time to time
to share [some work][bjjb] for free with the world at large.

[Here's][cv] my CV.
