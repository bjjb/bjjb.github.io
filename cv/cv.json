After doing my work experience there as part of the BSc in\nSoftware Development and Computer Networks, I was hired as a software engineer\nfor the embedded team.  There I worked primarily on protocol stacks for the\nvarious firmwares (always in C). After some time, I moved onto developing\nWindows drivers in C++. I discovered first Python and then Ruby whilst looking\nfor a solution to improve the build system for a newly acquired line of ISDN\nmodems and their driver packages. I later had the opportunity to write an early\nRails application which generates certificates for enabling driver features in\nEicon's entire telephony range. Thus encouraged, I decided to work on Rails\nfull-time.\n","website":"http://www.eiconworks.com","id":"eicon"},{"company":"Travel IQ","position":["Senior Software Developer","Architect"],"title":"Travel IQ","from":"2007","to":"2009","overview":"Travel IQ was my first experience with a start-up, and it brought me to\nBerlin. In 2006, after a telephone interview with the CTO, I was asked to come\nto Berlin to meet the team of the fledgeling startup. I moved to Friedrichshain\nin February 2007, and worked with Mathias and 4 part-time students to get the\napp online for August 1st. After the launch, as senior developer/architect in an\nexpanding team, we set about re-writing the platform for Rails 2. In October\n2008, version 2 was live, and in 2009, the company was aquired by Check24.\nMission accomplished, I left to travel.\n","website":"http://travel-iq.de","id":"tiq"},{"company":"eBay","from":"2010","to":"2012","position":["IT Consultant","Software Solutions Vendor"],"overview":"In between travels, I've done some project work for eBay GmbH in Dreilinden.\nI've whipped together a gem for using the eBay Trading API, and have built a\ncouple of Rails apps (one in Rails 2.3, and a more recent one Rails 3.2) which\nare used for ranking signed-up users by their eBay trading data. The apps are\nused internally by eBay to encourage customer engagement, and to push particular\nverticals as needed. Other work includes a HTML5 photo-gallery (my first\nintroduction to CarrierWave), and a mobile front-end to the eBay Open\nGlobal Competition app. As this is likely to continue, I spend some spare time\nimproving the eBay Open JSON API, and the open-source eBayR gem.\n","website":"http://ebay.com","links":["http://deutschland-index.com","http://pm.bjjbuckley.com","http://github.com/jjbuckley/ebayr"],"id":"ebay"},{"company":"TrainMySelf","position":["CTO"],"from":"2011","to":"2012","overview":"TrainMySelf GmbH is a company founded in 2011 by three guys from South Tyrol\nand me (as CTO and lead - sometimes only - developer).

Over the last year, we've hired a couple of additional\ndevelopers part-time and graphic designers, and it's grown to more of an\napp-platform - with an administration interface to allow customization of\nthe mobile apps, and a delivery system for PhoneGap applications, all\npowered by a JSON API which generates the training plans (in three\nlanguages).
