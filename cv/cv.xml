      <overview>Dialogic (formerly Eicon Networks) are a global manufacturer of ISDN and
DSL hardware. After doing my work experience there as part of the BSc in
Software Development and Computer Networks, I was hired as a software
engineer for the embedded team.  There I worked primarily on protocol
stacks for the various firmwares (always in C). After some time, I moved
onto developing Windows drivers in C++. I discovered first Python and then
Ruby whilst looking for a solution to improve the build system for a newly
acquired line of ISDN modems and their driver packages. I later had the
opportunity to write an early Rails application which generates
certificates for enabling driver features in the Eicon telephony hardware
range. Thus encouraged, I decided to work on Rails full-time.

      <overview>Travel IQ was my first experience with a start-up, and it brought me to
Berlin. In 2006, after a telephone interview with the CTO, I was asked to
come to Berlin to meet the team of the fledgeling startup. I moved to
Friedrichshain in February 2007, and worked with Mathias and 4 part-time
students to get the app online for August 1st. After the launch, as senior
developer/architect in an expanding team, we set about re-writing the
platform for Rails 2. In October 2008, version 2 was live, and in 2009,
the company was aquired by Check24.  Mission accomplished, I left to
travel.

      <overview>In between travels, I've done some project work for eBay GmbH in
Dreilinden.  I've whipped together a gem for using the eBay Trading API,
and have built a couple of Rails apps (one in Rails 2.3, and a more recent
one Rails 3.2) which are used for ranking signed-up users by their eBay
trading data. The apps are used internally by eBay to encourage customer
engagement, and to push particular verticals as needed. Other work
includes a HTML5 photo-gallery (my first introduction to CarrierWave), and
a mobile front-end to the eBay Open Global Competition app. As this is
likely to continue, I spend some spare time improving the eBay Open JSON
API, and the open-source eBayR gem.

      <overview>I was contracted by SAP to build an internal application, to manage their
security division's penetration tests every year. The app is mostly a
straightforward PostgreSQL backed RoR application, with incrementally more
detailed views for increasing levels of user responsibility, with
facilities to import data from Excel spreadsheets, and to generate PDF
reports. The app is continuously deployed in a docker container upon SAP's
internal PaaS system.

      <overview>For DaWanda, I was the senior consultant on several of their projects, the
largest and most challenging of which were the rearchitcture of their
backend system (to an elastic, zero-downtime distributed VS cluster), and
the overhaul of their UI to a mobile-first, responsive layout for all
user-facing pages. I returned in 2014 to provide a Sinatra replacement for
their core legacy Rails app for their API services. In between were
several short projects, including improving their image-uploading
services, remodelling some of their MySQL database, and designing and
coding miscellaneous APIs and gems for their consumption.

      <overview>TrainMySelf GmbH was a company founded in 2011 by three guys from South
Tyrol and me (as CTO and lead - sometimes only - developer). The idea was
to produce an iPhone and Android app that delivers customized training
plans to marathon runners. Over its latter years, we hired a couple of
additional developers part-time and graphic designers, and it grew to more
of an app-platform - with an administration interface to allow
customization of the mobile apps, and a delivery system for PhoneGap
applications, all powered by a JSON API which generates the training plans
(in three languages). TrainMySelf GmbH was disbanded in 2015, after
shifting the focus of the platform to health and recuperation apps. I took
the opportunity thereafter to travel around the Americas for a year.

      <overview>I joined Movinga in February 2016 just as they were looking to replace
their entire PHP stack with something shinier. Along with the V.P. of
product and the global head of engineering, we designed and prototyped a
scalable and comprehensive platform to integrate Salesforce, various
payment providers, logistics, intelligent pricing, and an ops admin
interface into a coherent and maintainable software stack.
As part of this reboot, as well as leading early development, I was
involved in the co-ordination of outsourced programming talent, hiring
in-house, training up existing PHP developers to work with Rails, and
fostering a tech-driven culture of balanced teams as the company grew
rapidly. Over the course of the year, we expanded the team from 2 Ruby
developers to over 30, and built a fully cloud-native micro-services
architecture, with complete automated test coverage and a CI/CD pipeline
based around Docker, Git and the GitLab CI runner.

creating toy mobile apps, making and running websites for small
businesses, working on numerous open-source projects, evaluating and
advising on network technology or software stacks, etc. As this kind of
general consultant, I am free to expand my skillset outside of narrow
specialisations, while delivering solutions to those who need weird and
wonderful things.
