  overview: |
    Dialogic (formerly Eicon Networks) are a global manufacturer of ISDN and
    DSL hardware. After doing my work experience there as part of the BSc in
    Software Development and Computer Networks, I was hired as a software
    engineer for the embedded team.  There I worked primarily on protocol
    stacks for the various firmwares (always in C). After some time, I moved
    onto developing Windows drivers in C++. I discovered first Python and then
    Ruby whilst looking for a solution to improve the build system for a newly
    acquired line of ISDN modems and their driver packages. I later had the
    opportunity to write an early Rails application which generates
    certificates for enabling driver features in the Eicon telephony hardware
    range. Thus encouraged, I decided to work on Rails full-time.

- company: Travel IQ
  position: 
  - Senior Software Developer
  - Architect
  title: Travel IQ
  from: "2007"
  to: "2009"
  overview: |
    Travel IQ was my first experience with a start-up, and it brought me to
    Berlin. In 2006, after a telephone interview with the CTO, I was asked to
    come to Berlin to meet the team of the fledgeling startup. I moved to
    Friedrichshain in February 2007, and worked with Mathias and 4 part-time
    students to get the app online for August 1st. After the launch, as senior
    developer/architect in an expanding team, we set about re-writing the
    platform for Rails 2. In October 2008, version 2 was live, and in 2009,
    the company was aquired by Check24.  Mission accomplished, I left to
    travel.

- company: eBay
  from: "2010"
  to: "2016"
  position:
  - IT Consultant
  - Software Solutions Vendor
  overview: |
    In between travels, I've done some project work for eBay GmbH in
    Dreilinden.  I've whipped together a gem for using the eBay Trading API,
    and have built a couple of Rails apps (one in Rails 2.3, and a more recent
    one Rails 3.2) which are used for ranking signed-up users by their eBay
    trading data. The apps are used internally by eBay to encourage customer
    engagement, and to push particular verticals as needed. Other work
    includes a HTML5 photo-gallery (my first introduction to CarrierWave), and
    a mobile front-end to the eBay Open Global Competition app. As this is
    likely to continue, I spend some spare time improving the eBay Open JSON
    API, and the open-source eBayR gem.

- company: SAP
  position:
  - Software Solutions Vendor
  from: "2014"
  to: "2014"
  overview: |
    I was contracted by SAP to build an internal application, to manage their
    security division's penetration tests every year. The app is mostly a
    straightforward PostgreSQL backed RoR application, with incrementally more
    detailed views for increasing levels of user responsibility, with
    facilities to import data from Excel spreadsheets, and to generate PDF
    reports. The app is continuously deployed in a docker container upon SAP's
    internal PaaS system.

- company: DaWanda
  position:
  - Software Consultant
  from: "2012"
  to: "2014"
  overview: |
    For DaWanda, I was the senior consultant on several of their projects, the
    largest and most challenging of which were the rearchitcture of their
    backend system (to an elastic, zero-downtime distributed VS cluster), and
    the overhaul of their UI to a mobile-first, responsive layout for all
    user-facing pages. I returned in 2014 to provide a Sinatra replacement for
    their core legacy Rails app for their API services. In between were
    several short projects, including improving their image-uploading
    services, remodelling some of their MySQL database, and designing and
    coding miscellaneous APIs and gems for their consumption.

- company: TrainMySelf
  position:
  - CTO
  from: "2011"
  to: "2015"
  overview: |
    TrainMySelf GmbH was a company founded in 2011 by three guys from South
    Tyrol and me (as CTO and lead - sometimes only - developer). The idea was
    to produce an iPhone and Android app that delivers customized training
    plans to marathon runners. Over its latter years, we hired a couple of
    additional developers part-time and graphic designers, and it grew to more
    of an app-platform - with an administration interface to allow
    customization of the mobile apps, and a delivery system for PhoneGap
    applications, all powered by a JSON API which generates the training plans
    (in three languages). TrainMySelf GmbH was disbanded in 2015, after
    shifting the focus of the platform to health and recuperation apps. I took
    the opportunity thereafter to travel around the Americas for a year.

- company: Movinga
  position:
  - Software Consultant
  from: "2016"
  to: "2017"
  overview: |
    I joined Movinga in February 2016 just as they were looking to replace
    their entire PHP stack with something shinier. Along with the V.P. of
    product and the global head of engineering, we designed and prototyped a
    scalable and comprehensive platform to integrate Salesforce, various
    payment providers, logistics, intelligent pricing, and an ops admin
    interface into a coherent and maintainable software stack.
    As part of this reboot, as well as leading early development, I was
    involved in the co-ordination of outsourced programming talent, hiring
    in-house, training up existing PHP developers to work with Rails, and
    fostering a tech-driven culture of balanced teams as the company grew
    rapidly. Over the course of the year, we expanded the team from 2 Ruby
    developers to over 30, and built a fully cloud-native micro-services
    architecture, with complete automated test coverage and a CI/CD pipeline
    based around Docker, Git and the GitLab CI runner.

    Between long-term projects, I like to keep busy in a wide range of areas -
    creating toy mobile apps, making and running websites for small
    businesses, working on numerous open-source projects, evaluating and
    advising on network technology or software stacks, etc. As this kind of
    general consultant, I am free to expand my skillset outside of narrow
