  overview: |
    Dialogic (formerly Eicon Networks) are a global manufacturer of ISDN and DSL
    hardware. After doing my work experience there as part of the BSc in
    Software Development and Computer Networks, I was hired as a software engineer
    for the embedded team.  There I worked primarily on protocol stacks for the
    various firmwares (always in C). After some time, I moved onto developing
    Windows drivers in C++. I discovered first Python and then Ruby whilst looking
    for a solution to improve the build system for a newly acquired line of ISDN
    modems and their driver packages. I later had the opportunity to write an early
    Rails application which generates certificates for enabling driver features in
    Eicon's entire telephony range. Thus encouraged, I decided to work on Rails
    full-time.

- company: Travel IQ
  position: 
  - Senior Software Developer
  - Architect
  title: Travel IQ
  from: "2007"
  to: "2009"
  overview: |
    Travel IQ was my first experience with a start-up, and it brought me to
    Berlin. In 2006, after a telephone interview with the CTO, I was asked to come
    to Berlin to meet the team of the fledgeling startup. I moved to Friedrichshain
    in February 2007, and worked with Mathias and 4 part-time students to get the
    app online for August 1st. After the launch, as senior developer/architect in an
    expanding team, we set about re-writing the platform for Rails 2. In October
    2008, version 2 was live, and in 2009, the company was aquired by Check24.
    Mission accomplished, I left to travel.

- company: eBay
  from: "2010"
  to: "2016"
  position:
  - IT Consultant
  - Software Solutions Vendor
  overview: |
    In between travels, I've done some project work for eBay GmbH in Dreilinden.
    I've whipped together a gem for using the eBay Trading API, and have built a
    couple of Rails apps (one in Rails 2.3, and a more recent one Rails 3.2) which
    are used for ranking signed-up users by their eBay trading data. The apps are
    used internally by eBay to encourage customer engagement, and to push particular
    verticals as needed. Other work includes a HTML5 photo-gallery (my first
    introduction to CarrierWave), and a mobile front-end to the eBay Open
    Global Competition app. As this is likely to continue, I spend some spare time
    improving the eBay Open JSON API, and the open-source eBayR gem.

- company: SAP
  position:
  - Software Solutions Vendor
  from: "2014"
  to: "2014"
  overview: |
    I was contracted by SAP to build an internal application, to manage their
    security division's penetration tests every year. The app is mostly a
    straightforward PostgreSQL backed RoR application, with incrementally more
    detailed views for increasing levels of user responsibility, with
    facilities to import data from Excel spreadsheets, and to generate PDF
    reports. The app is continuously deployed in a docker container upon SAP's
    internal PaaS system.

- company: DaWanda
  position:
  - Software Consultant
  from: "2012"
  to: "2014"
  overview: |
    For DaWanda, I was the senior consultant on several of their projects, the
    largest and most challenging of which were the rearchitcture of their
    backend system (to an elastic, zero-downtime distributed VS cluster), and
    the overhaul of their UI to a mobile-first, responsive layout for all
    user-facing pages. I returned in 2014 to provide a Sinatra replacement for
    their core legacy Rails app for their API services. In between were
    several short projects, including improving their image-uploading
    services, remodelling some of their MySQL database, and designing and
    coding miscellaneous APIs and gems for their consumption.

- company: TrainMySelf
  position:
  - CTO
  from: "2011"
  to: "2016"
  overview: |
    TrainMySelf GmbH is a company founded in 2011 by three guys from South Tyrol
    and me (as CTO and lead - sometimes only - developer). The idea was to
    produce an iPhone and Android app that delivers customized training plans to
    marathon runners. Over the last year, we've hired a couple of additional
    developers part-time and graphic designers, and it's grown to more of an
    app-platform - with an administration interface to allow customization of
    the mobile apps, and a delivery system for PhoneGap applications, all
    powered by a JSON API which generates the training plans (in three
    languages). TrainMySelf is due to be in beta in early June, at which point I
    will be ready to devote the bulk of my energy to another exciting project.
