          Here are my current GitHub-hosted open-source projects. Please feel
          free to fork and improve anything you find even remotely useful.

          These generally address some HTML5 tasks that I found myself having
          to repeat time and again.

        <h1><a href='draiodoir'>Draíodóir</a></h1>
        <p>
          A JavaScript to turn a HTML5 &lt;form&gt; into a multi-step wizard.
        </p>
        <p>
          It demands semantic and modern HTML, and shows one &lt;fieldset&gt;
          at a time, hijacking the form's submission until it thinks it's
          complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          The homepage has some vanilla examples of the script in action.
        </p>

        <h1><a href='bailitheoir'>Bailitheoir</a></h1>
        <p>
          A small JavaScript implementation of the
          <a href='http://www.w3.org'>W3</a>'s HTML5 form constraints
          specification.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although some of
          <a href='http://mozilla.com/firefox'>the</a>
          <a href='http://apple.com/safari'>better</a>
          <a href='http://google.com/chrome'>browsers</a> already have
          some form of constraints validation on HTML5 forms, none of them
          (right now) seem to have implemented it completely.
        </p>
        <p>
          This small JavaScript library addresses some of the issues. The
          homepage has a small form which utilises the constraints.
        </p>

      <article>
        <h1><a href='fs'>FS (Feidhm Soghluaiseacht)</a></h1>
        <p>
          A boilerplate mobile web application. Write some
          <a rel='external' href='http://www.w3.org/TR/html5'>standard</a>s
          compliant HTML5, and plug this in to have an application that runs
          on iPhone or Android phones.
        </p>
        <p>
          The homepage itself uses the script, so viewing the source is
          probably the best way to see how it works.
